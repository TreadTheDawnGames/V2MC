# Video to Minecraft Resource Pack Converter - Desktop App

This is a tool which converts videos to the resources required to watch it in Minecraft 1.20.4. It is multiplayer friendly so you can watch with friends!

## Notes
I am working on an installer. Cloning this repo will probably not result in a functioning app.

This project uses FFmpeg, FFprobe and ImageMagick.NET.

Tested with FFmpeg 6.1.
